============
SHA256 pcore
============

This pcore would be fantastic if I had time and real stimulus, but with the
idea of not going too undeterministic I will try to do some stages on this.

First approach
--------------

  * The pcore will use only a axi lite interface.
     This is because I will map all input and outputs in registers
  * The software library will do no processing for the user
     It makes harder to know what the hell is going on. Static mapping is 
     easier. You put the data chunk you want to process, you may also put the
     last hash result in the input_hash, and you would get the result in
     other registers.
  * The drivers include a selftest app that takes the module base pointer
     and executes tests.
